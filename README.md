# Unemployement-In-India-during-COVID19-PowerBI-Project
Welcome to this Unemployement Rate In Inida during COVID-19 Power BI Project.
I have created this project during my Data Analytics Internship at CognoRise.

During this project I have analyzed the unemployment rate in India during COVID- 19 and identify unemployment rate by states, year & month, area (rural or urban); and average employed people by states and areas.

**I have uploaded a Video Presentation of this Project on My linkedIn profile: www.linkedin.com/in/iamutsavraj**

**I'm uploading the dataset as well as Dashboard File in this repository.**

Thank You for visiting.
